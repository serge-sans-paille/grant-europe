\subsubsection*{Previous projects or activities}

Current grants:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
 ANR PEACE (2012-2015)
    Goal: The discrete logarithm problem on algebraic curves is one of the rare
    contact points between deep theoretical questions in arithmetic geometry and
    every day applications. On the one side it involves a better understanding,
    from an effective point of view, of moduli space of curves, of abelian
    varieties, the maps that link these spaces and the objects they classify.
    On the other side, new and efficient algorithms to compute the discrete
    logarithm problem would have dramatic consequences on the security and
    efficiency of already deployed cryptographic devices. 

\item
ERC starting grant ANTICS (2011-2016) 
    Goal: "Rebuild algorithmic number theory on the firm grounds of theoretical
    computer science".
    Challenges: complexity (how fast can an algorithm be?), reliability
    (how correct should an algorithm be?), parallelisation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Significant infrastructure}
\TOWRITE{VD}{this still needs to be done}

Two center for computations: Plafrim and Avakas.

\begin{draft}
\vspace{1cm}\TOWRITE{VD}{Complete check list below -- delete completed items if you wish}

\begin{verbatim}
- [ ] checked that sum of person months put into finance request is
  the same as sum of person months associated with the Work Packages
  (in proposal.tex, as defined as part of the \begin{workpackage}"
  command.
  
  Take into account person months associated with work package 1, time
  of all staff to be hired and work on the project (including
  investigators). Figure 5 helps with a quick check of the sums over
  different work packages.

- [ ] completed site specific resource summary in resources.tex,
  including table of non-staff costs. This is compulsory (EU
  regulations) if the non-staff cost exceed 15% of the total cost, and
  is likely to be the case for most of the partners. We ask everybody
  to do it, to be consistent and show transparently how we have
  planned our total budget.

- [ ] Have all our tasks a designated lead institution? Check in the
  Work Packages that all the tasks you are involved in have a
  dedicated lead party. If the lead party is "USO", then use:
  \begin{task}[lead=USO]

- [ ] Have all our deliverables a designated lead institution [using
  the 'lead=' key]?

- [ ] In the "Members of the consortium section", have we addressed "a
  description of the legal entity and its main tasks, with an
  explanation of how its profile matches the tasks in the
  proposal"? See Entry for Paris Sud and Southampton as examples.

- [ ] In the Members of the consortium section, have we given
  descriptions of all the people we intend to hire (even if we don't
  know who that is yet).
