The University of Oxford is in the top ten universities worldwide in the Shanghai 2013 and 2014
rankings (the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford are the only non-US university there).
It employs over 10,000 staff and has a student population of over 21,000.
Most staff are directly appointed and managed by one of the University’s 130 departments or
other units within a highly devolved operational structure - this includes 5,900 ‘academic related’
staff (postgraduate research, computing, senior library, and administrative staff) and
2,820 ‘support’ staff (including clerical, library, technical, and manual staff). There are also
over 1,600 academic staff (professors, readers, lecturers), whose appointments are in the
main overseen by a combination of broader divisional and local faculty board/departmental
structures. 

The Department of Computer Science is one of the longest established
Computer Science departments in the country. Formerly known as the
University Computing Laboratory, it is home to a community of world-class research and
teaching. Research activities encompass core Computer Science, as well as Security,
Algorithms, computational biology, quantum computing, computational linguistics,
information systems, software verification and software engineering. 

The department is home to undergraduates, full-time and part-time Master's
students, and has a strong doctoral programme.  Students are highly skilled and
motivated, and as practice shows, easily start contributing to open-source
projects such as Sagemath.

\begin{verbatim}
- [ ] checked that sum of person months put into finance request is
  the same as sum of person months associated with the Work Packages
  (in proposal.tex, as defined as part of the \begin{workpackage}"
  command.
  
  Take into account person months associated with work package 1, time
  of all staff to be hired and work on the project (including
  investigators). Figure 5 helps with a quick check of the sums over
  different work packages.

- [ ] completed site specific resource summary in resources.tex,
  including table of non-staff costs. This is compulsory (EU
  regulations) if the non-staff cost exceed 15% of the total cost, and
  is likely to be the case for most of the partners. We ask everybody
  to do it, to be consistent and show transparently how we have
  planned our total budget.

- [ ] Have all our tasks a designated lead institution? Check in the
  Work Packages that all the tasks you are involved in have a
  dedicated lead party. If the lead party is "USO", then use:
  \begin{task}[lead=USO]

- [ ] Have all our deliverables a designated lead institution [using
  the 'lead=' key]?

- [ ] In the "Members of the consortium section", have we addressed "a
  description of the legal entity and its main tasks, with an
  explanation of how its profile matches the tasks in the
  proposal"? See Entry for Paris Sud and Southampton as examples.

- [ ] In the Members of the consortium section, have we given
  descriptions of all the people we intend to hire (even if we don't
  know who that is yet).
