The Université Joseph Fourier (UJF) partner gathers two teams form the Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann
(CASYS team, with Jean-Guillaume Dumas) and the Laboratoire d’Informatique de
Grenoble (MOAIS, Clément Pernet). The 
CASYS team is specialized in Algebraic computations, cryptology, codes and hybrid symbolic-numeric dynamical systems. The MOAIS team is specialized in programming and scheduling
design on distributed resources for applications based on interactive simulation. The software
developed by this partner is significant. It includes the exact arithmetic
library \Givaro, the exact linear algebra libraries \fflas and \Linbox, and the
parallel programming runtime XKAAPI.

\item[Software projects]\
  \begin{description}
 \item[\texttt{fflas-ffpack}:] An open-source \texttt{C++} library offering dense
    linear algebra kernels over a finite field. In the same  spirit as the
    numerical \texttt{BLAS} (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines), and
    \texttt{LAPACK} libraries, it delivers high performance for the most
    commonly used routines of scientific computing: matrix multiplication,
    solving linear systems, computing echelon forms, determinants,
    characteristic polynomials, etc. This library has set the standard
    approach for high performance exact dense linear algebra. It is currently
    used in \texttt{Sage}, and has inspired the design of similar routines in
    most commercial computer algebra softwares: \texttt{maple}, \texttt{magma}, etc.
  \item[\texttt{LinBox}:] An open-source \texttt{C++} middleware library for
    exact linear algebra. It uses \texttt{fflas-ffpack} for its dense finite
    field linear algebra part and extends its functionalities to other
    computation domains (integers, rationals, polynomial rings) and type
    matrices (sparse and structures matrices, black-box
    matrices). \texttt{LinBox} is integrated in \texttt{Sage}. 
  \item[\texttt{Pythran}:] An open-source \Python-to-\texttt{C++} optimizing compiler
    offering an high performance runtime for Scientific Python kernels. Dynamicity of
    the \Python language is not compliant with static compilation. That's why only
    a subset of the \Python language is supported by \Pythran. Thanks to these
    restrictions, \Pythran generate code up to 3000 faster than original module.
    \Pythran takes advantage of mutli-cores and SIMD instruction units and,
    thanks to type inference, it requires little annotations. Its runtime
    supports a growing subset of the \Numpy package.

\begin{verbatim}
- [X] checked that sum of person months put into finance request is
  the same as sum of person months associated with the Work Packages
  (in proposal.tex, as defined as part of the \begin{workpackage}"
  command.
  
  Take into account person months associated with work package 1, time
  of all staff to be hired and work on the project (including
  investigators). Figure 5 helps with a quick check of the sums over
  different work packages.

- [ ] completed site specific resource summary in resources.tex,
  including table of non-staff costs. This is compulsory (EU
  regulations) if the non-staff cost exceed 15% of the total cost, and
  is likely to be the case for most of the partners. We ask everybody
  to do it, to be consistent and show transparently how we have
  planned our total budget.

- [X] Have all our tasks a designated lead institution? Check in the
  Work Packages that all the tasks you are involved in have a
  dedicated lead party. If the lead party is "USO", then use:
  \begin{task}[lead=USO]

- [X] Have all our deliverables a designated lead institution [using
  the 'lead=' key]?

- [ ] In the "Members of the consortium section", have we addressed "a
  description of the legal entity and its main tasks, with an
  explanation of how its profile matches the tasks in the
  proposal"? See Entry for Paris Sud and Southampton as examples.

- [ ] In the Members of the consortium section, have we given
  descriptions of all the people we intend to hire (even if we don't
  know who that is yet).
