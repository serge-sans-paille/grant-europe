\begin{draft}
\TOWRITE{NK}{Who is the lead from Logilab? (Enter below in TOWRITE)}\\
\vspace{1cm}\TOWRITE{Logilab}{Complete check list below -- delete completed items if you wish}

\begin{verbatim}
- [ ] checked that sum of person months put into finance request is
  the same as sum of person months associated with the Work Packages
  (in proposal.tex, as defined as part of the \begin{workpackage}"
  command.
  
  Take into account person months associated with work package 1, time
  of all staff to be hired and work on the project (including
  investigators). Figure 5 helps with a quick check of the sums over
  different work packages.

- [ ] completed site specific resource summary in resources.tex,
  including table of non-staff costs. This is compulsory (EU
  regulations) if the non-staff cost exceed 15% of the total cost, and
  is likely to be the case for most of the partners. We ask everybody
  to do it, to be consistent and show transparently how we have
  planned our total budget.

- [ ] Have all our tasks a designated lead institution? Check in the
  Work Packages that all the tasks you are involved in have a
  dedicated lead party. If the lead party is "USO", then use:
  \begin{task}[lead=USO]

- [ ] Have all our deliverables a designated lead institution [using
  the 'lead=' key]?

- [ ] In the "Members of the consortium section", have we addressed "a
  description of the legal entity and its main tasks, with an
  explanation of how its profile matches the tasks in the
  proposal"? See Entry for Paris Sud and Southampton as examples.

- [ ] In the Members of the consortium section, have we given
  descriptions of all the people we intend to hire (even if we don't
  know who that is yet).
