\TOWRITE{ALL}{Rework the following with two meetings per year (that is
  9 total with the Kickoff meeting); and as many milestones (except
  for the Kickoff); further argue that, given that most of the tasks
  are independent, there is no specific needs for technical
  milestones.}

The work in the \TheProject project is structured by seven milestones,
which coincide with the project meetings.  Since the meetings are the
main face-to-face interaction points in the project, it is suitable to
schedule the milestones for these events, where they can be discussed
in detail. We envision that this setup will give the project the vital
coherence in spite of the broad mix of disciplinary backgrounds of the
participants.

\TODO{Improve the description of the milestones}
\begin{milestones}
  \milestone[id=kickoff,verif=meeting report,month=1]

    {Set up the organizational infrastructure, in particular: Web Presence, project TRAC,\ldots}
  \milestone[id=consensus,verif=Inspection,month=24]{Consensus} {Reach Consensus on the
    way the project goes}
  \milestone[id=exploitation,verif=Inspection,month=36]{Exploitation}{The exploitation
    plan should be clear so that we can start on this in the last year.}
  \milestone[id=final,verif=Inspection,month=48]{Final Results}{all is done}
