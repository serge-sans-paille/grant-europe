  at Southampton, under the leadership of and together with Hans
  Fangohr. The fellow will have a background in computational science,
  ideally in micromagnetics, combined with solid IPython and
  \Jupyter{} Notebook experience, and past experience of software
  engineering. We further require good communication and team working
  skills, and in particular interest and skill in the development of
  education materials to best support this part of the project.
